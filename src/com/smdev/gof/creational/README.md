# Creational Design Patterns (5)

### Abstract Factory aka "Factory of Factories"
* Designed to create families of objects without specifying their concrete classes
* The type will be determined at runtime.

### Builder Pattern
* Designed to improve the readability of the code when we have to build complex objects with a lot of optional fields
* Designed to ensure that the objects is always in a consistent state

### Factory Method
* Defines the interface, but lets subclasses to decide which concrete class to instantiate
* Refers to the newly created object through a common interface
* "Creation through inheritance"

# Design parking lot

Design and implement multistory parking lot.

What patterns are going to use? How would you implement it?

## Short Analysis
We need parking lot, that:
* has multiple levels (multi storey car park)
* has multiple entries on each floor
* has multiple exits on each floor
* has parking spaces of multiple sizes
* has multiple displays on each floor that show information about available parking spaces
* some parking spaces may have additional/ optional features like electric panel for charging electric cars
* can issue tickets and track time
* generate final bills, based on the parking space features (size, electric panel etc.) and time
* allows different billing strategies like - per hour/ per 24-hours, monthly or yearly subscription
* allow multiple payment options - by card, cache

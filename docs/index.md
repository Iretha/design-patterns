The design patterns got very popular when the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)" was published. 
The four authors of the book: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides are known as the Gang of Four (GoF).
Тhe 23 software design patterns, described in the book, are called "GoF Design Patterns". 

## GoF Design Patterns
The GoF Design Patterns are mostly *fundamental*. They are one of the most popular and the most widely used design patterns. 
The fundamental patterns are divided into 3 categories:

* [Creational Design Patterns](/design-patterns/creational)

The Creational Design Patterns deal with the way objects are created/ instantiated. 

* [Structural Design Patterns](/design-patterns/structural)

The Structural Design Patterns deal with the relations between components and objects. 

* [Behavioral Design Patterns](/design-patterns/behavioral)

The Behavioral Design Patterns deal with the communication between objects.

## Other Design Patterns
The constantly evolving technologies not only solve problems, but also introduce new ones.
To solve them, we need new patterns and even new categories.

Here is list of some of the categories:
* Architectural Design Patterns
* Integration Design Patterns
* Data Model Patterns
* Analysis Patterns
* Core J2EE Patterns
* Deployment Patterns
* etc...

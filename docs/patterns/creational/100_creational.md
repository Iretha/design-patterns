# Creational Design Patterns

The Creational Design Patterns deal with the way objects are created/ instantiated. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

## Types
* class-creational patterns ("creation through inheritance") - the "child" object inherits properties and behavior from the parent object
* object-creational patterns ("creation through delegation") - the object creation is delegated to another object

## Purpose
* to encapsulate knowledge about the concrete classes 
* to hide complexity from client 
* to hide from client how the object is created/ composed (client is decoupled from the initialization process)
* to allow us to replace the implementation with ease

## Patterns
There are 5 creational patterns introduced by GoF. 
Later we will add some more useful patterns to this list.
* [Abstract Factory (GoF)]()
* Builder Pattern (GoF)
* Factory Method (GoF)
* Prototype (GoF)
* Singleton (GoF)
* Object Pool (TODO)

# GoF Design Patterns (23)

Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994) is a software engineering book describing software design patterns. 
The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (the "Gang of Four"),[1] with a foreword by 
Grady Booch. The book is divided into two parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of 
object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters describing 23 classic software design patterns. 

## Creational Design Patterns (5)

### Abstract Factory aka "Factory of Factories"
* Designed to create families of objects without specifying their concrete classes
* The type will be determined at runtime.

### Builder Pattern
* Designed to improve the readability of the code when we have to build complex objects with a lots of optional fields
* Designed to ensure that the objects is always in a consistent state

# GoF Design Patterns (23)

Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994) is a software engineering book describing software design patterns. 
The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (the "Gang of Four"),[1] with a foreword by 
Grady Booch. The book is divided into two parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of 
object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters describing 23 classic software design patterns.

### Summary
Creational Design Patterns have to deal with object creation/ instantiation. They reduce complexity and hide 
from client how the object is created. The client is entirely decoupled from the actual initialization process
and the implementation could be easily replaced if necessary.

### Consider applying creational patterns when:
- A system should be independent of how its objects and products are created.
- A set of related objects is designed to be used together.
- Hiding the implementations of a class library or product, revealing only their interfaces.
- Constructing different representation of independent complex objects.
- A class wants its subclass to implement the object it creates.
- The class instantiations are specified at run-time.
- There must be a single instance and client can access this instance at all times.
- Instance should be extensible without being modified.

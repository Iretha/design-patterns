# GoF Design Patterns (23)

A design pattern is reusable solution of a commonly occurring problem (usually in software design). 

Design Patterns got very popular when the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)" 
was published. The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (known as the "Gang of Four" / GoF).
The book is divided into two parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of 
object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters describing 23 classic software design patterns.

Design patterns were originally grouped into the categories: 
## [GoF Creational Design Patterns (5)](https://github.com/Iretha/ebook-design-patterns/blob/master/src/com/smdev/gof/creational)

Creational Design Patterns have to deal with object creation/ instantiation. They reduce complexity and hide 
from client how the object is created. The client is entirely decoupled from the actual initialization process
and the implementation could be easily replaced if necessary.


## [GoF Structural Design Patterns (7)](https://github.com/Iretha/ebook-design-patterns/blob/master/src/com/smdev/gof/structural)
Structural Design Patterns have to deal with the relations between components and objects. 
They simplify the structure by identifying the relationships and ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.


## [GoF Behavioral Design Patterns (11)](https://github.com/Iretha/ebook-design-patterns/blob/master/src/com/smdev/gof/behavioral)

Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects. 
By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
